# 👨‍💻 Welcome to learn_c

Ready to master the C language from the ground up? Whether you're just starting out or diving deep into system-level wizardry, **learn_c** is your hands-on guide to becoming fluent in one of the most powerful programming languages ever created.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This repo is a curated journey through C programming, organized into progressive levels:

- 🟢 **Beginner** – Syntax, variables, loops, functions, and more  
- 🟡 **Intermediate** – Pointers, memory, files, recursion, and debugging  
- 🔴 **Advanced** – Data structures, multithreading, system-level programming  
- 🟣 **Expert** –Topic-focused deep dives into system design, security, networking, and compiler internals *(no code examples or exercises—just pure knowledge to explore)*

## 🎯 Why You'll Love It

- 📚 Clear, modular lessons with real code examples  
- 🧪 Ten exercises in each section to reinforce learning  
- 🛠️  Final project challenges to test your skills  

So grab your compiler, crack open a terminal, and let’s get coding.  
C ya in the code! 😉

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Not all exercise solutions are complete yet—I'm solving them as I learn, so this repo grows with me. Feel free to follow along or even contribute!**

# 🎓 04-Final Projects by Level

Each level comes with fun, hands-on projects to help you apply what you've learned. From tiny tools to terminal adventures—these are your coding quests!

---

### 🟢 Beginner Level Projects – *“C is for Curious!”*

1. **🧮 Tiny Calculator**  
   Your first math buddy! Add, subtract, multiply, and divide like a pro—with functions doing the heavy lifting.

2. **🎯 Guess the Number**  
   The computer picks a number. You try to guess it. It taunts you with “higher” or “lower” until you win. Or rage quit.

3. **📊 Grade-o-Matic**  
   Enter student scores, calculate averages, and hand out virtual gold stars (or gentle reminders to study harder).

4. **🏧 ATM Simulator**  
   Simulate checking your balance, depositing imaginary cash, and withdrawing like a boss—with a menu-driven interface.

5. **🌡️ Temp Transformer**  
   Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Because science is cool. Literally.

### 🟡 Intermediate Level Projects – *“Pointers and Power-Ups!”*

1. **📇 Contact Book 2.0**  
   Store names, numbers, and secrets. Search, edit, and save them to a file—like a digital diary with structs.

2. 🐍 [**Classic Snake Game**](04-Final_projects/01-Intermediate/snake_game)  
   Navigate your snake through the terminal jungle. Eat, grow, and avoid crashing—pure retro fun powered by C logic.

3. **📦 Dynamic Array Manager**  
   Build your own resizable array using `malloc` and `realloc`. It’s like giving your variables superpowers.

4. **🧠 Quiz Master**  
   Load questions from a file, track scores, and challenge your friends. Bonus points if you make it snarky.

5. **📁 Text File Analyzer**  
   Feed it a file. It’ll count words, lines, letters, and maybe judge your writing habits.

### 🔴 Advanced Level Projects – *“Code Like a Cyborg!”*

1. **📚 Library Management System**  
   Use linked lists to track books, borrowers, and overdue fines. No actual librarians were harmed.

2. **🧩 Maze Solver**  
   Generate a maze and escape it using recursion or algorithms. Bonus: make it visual in the terminal!

3. **🚀 Multithreaded Download Simulator**  
   Pretend to download files using threads. Watch your fake progress bars fly!

4. **🧠 Custom Memory Allocator**  
   Build your own version of `malloc`. Manage memory like a boss. Just don’t leak it everywhere.

5. **🛠️ Mini Compiler Front-End**  
   Create a lexer and parser for a tiny language. Teach your code to read code. Meta, right?
